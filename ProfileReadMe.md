# Ikraan Ahmed 
_Hello there👋<br> My name is Ikraan Ahmed and I am a black codher bootcamp student.
<br> Below I will be discussing what I have learnt so far in the BlackCodher bootcamp and what I am still confused about._
<hr> 

## **What I learnt:** 
    + I learnt about different areas of development, sotftware development, source control and management systems. 
    + I learnt how to create and move into different branches,folders and files.
    + I learnt how to create a repository in my github and adding commits.
    + I learnt how to use command line and git and how to use the right commands to get the right output in terminal. 
    + I learnt how to create new folders and add content.
    + I learnt and currently still experimenting using different styles of text when creating a README markdown.

## **What I am still confused about:**
Overall, I understand how Github works, how it is used but I am still finding it quite difficult when it comes to connecting to my remote server or when connecting to my github repositories and pushing content. <br> In addition to pushing there are occasions when it works but other times it shows errors; saying there is an existing repository etc.
<br>
However I will continue researching and having a try at it multiple times to familiarise with all of it.
